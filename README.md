Iris Project April 2018
The following project deals with the Iris Data set first published in 1936 by Ronald Fischer in his paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. The data and associated paper tries to distinguish between three species of Iris, Iris selosa, I. versicolor and I. virginica, based on four linear, plant characteristics:

Petal width, 
Petal length, 
Sepal width, 
Sepal length.

Sample data has 50 data entries for each species.

The enlcosed file entitled Iris.py, utilises this data source and summariese the following aspects of the dataset:

1. Data.head shows a summary of teh first 5 rows of data, depciting the data format and type.
2. Species list-lists the species of Iris that measurements were taken from.
3. Data range and data standard deviation-gives the range for each characteristic and its standard deviation within the data set.
4. Data summary-overall summary of data set. 
5. Species summary-mean of data per characteristic per species of Iris.

Tables for the data summary and Species summary can be found in the Iris_data output.csv file.

The summarised data can be used to differentiate the different species for example if you look at the mean Sepal Length and Petal width are much smaller in I. setosa compared to the other two species.
